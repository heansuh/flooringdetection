**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: [Image segmentation | TensorFlow Core]

  - **[Link]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05566?utm_source=chatgpt.com](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation))**
  - **Objective**: It provides a practical guide for implementing image segmentation using TensorFlow, specifically a U-Net model.
  - **Methods**: This tutorial explains how to prepare datasets, construct a U-Net model, and train it for segmenting objects in images.
  - **Outcomes**: The tutorial demonstrates how to achieve efficient segmentation, offering insights into building models for similar tasks.
  - **Relation to the Project**: The detailed implementation process can serve as a foundation for designing and training a flooring segmentation model.

- **Source 2**: [Parkettkaiser]

  - **[Link](https://www.parkettkaiser.de/eu-en/)**
  - **Objective**: It provides a good selection of flooring products, including parquet, laminate, and vinyl, with accompanying room images.
  - **Methods**: The website showcases various flooring options with high-quality images depicting installed products in different room settings.
  - **Outcomes**: Offers a visual reference for flooring types and their applications in interior design.
  - **Relation to the Project**: The room images available can be utilized to build a dataset for training machine learning models in flooring detection.

- **Source 3**: [Floor Segmentation Using Deep Learning]

  - **[Link](https://github.com/uzair-mughal/Floor-Segmentation)**
  - **Objective**: To provide a deep learning-based model for floor segmentation, enabling transparent floor pixel generation for testing new designs.
  - **Methods**: It utilizes Python libraries such as TensorFlow and OpenCV for training and inference.
    The project involves preprocessing images, training a segmentation model, and applying the model to segment floor areas in real-time.
  - **Outcomes**: Successfully segments floor areas, making floor pixels transparent, which can be used for various applications like interior design visualization.
  - **Relation to the Project**: Offers a complete (hopefully) Python implementation for floor segmentation, which can be adapted for detecting and classifying flooring types in room images.
